# Project Euler Solutions

This repository serves as a record of my attempts at the challenges on [ProjectEuler.net](http://projecteuler.net/). Feel free to browse through my solutions for comparison. My code is not meant to be a crutch for independent attempts at the problems.

> There is nothing quite like that "Aha!" moment when you finally beat a problem which you have been working on for some time... Real learning is an active process and seeing how it is done is a long way from experiencing that epiphany of discovery.
